$Slide_T0_00	Welcome Writer ! Since you are new to TaleTeller, let's have a quick lesson so your future book will be a bestseller !<br><br>Are you ready ? It won't last long !
$Slide_T0_01	Like any card-game, Taleteller is all about turns. <br>Writing Phase :<br>First, you are able to prepare your Storyline. Cards can be placed on the slots.<br>Think about the actions of each card and how you order them.<br>Once you’re done, click on the GO button.<br><br>Reading Phase :<br>Your Hero takes the lead from here on !<br>He will cross the cards, left to right, triggering their effects one by one.<br>When he reaches the end of the Storyline, the turn ends so another can begin.
$Slide_T0_02	To keep it simple, the Hero only has three statistics :<br> - His health (HP), don't let it run out or the hero will die.<br> - His strength (ATK) is the amount of damage the hero will deal to his foes.<br> - His coins (GOLD). They will help the hero trigger some card effects.<br> As your hero progresses in the story, his statistics and their maximum can be upgraded. Everybody likes a good character development ! 
$Slide_T1_00	A card is composed of several components :<br>In the top left corner, you find the amount of ink needed to place this card.<br><br>In the center,  you can read it's effects. Each effect has a target , represented by an icone, that will be impacted by the effect.<br><br>Sometimes a card might have a colored gem that represents it's rarity.
$Slide_T2_00	Another type of card is called “Characters”. Like the Hero, they have a HP value and an ATK value.
$Slide_T2_01	"Characters" are divided into “Allies” and “Enemies”. If they are placed next to each other, they will exchange blows.<br><br>If they run out of health, the card is sent to the discard pile. 
$Slide_T2_02	The Characters also have a Number of Use. It is indicated on the top right corner of the card. It indicates the number of times the card can be used.
$Slide_T3_00	If you want your book to be interesting, you need to confront your Hero to plots. To do so, you will have to deal with a new type of cards : the Plots !<br><br>If you succeed in completing their objective,  you can go to the next Chapter / Act. You have to complete all the Plots you’ve got to end your book.<br><br>But be careful ! Those cards also have a timer. If it goes to 0, then you will fail in writing your Book. You can consider it as a Game Over.<br><br>Most of the Plot will give you Extras, which are basically cards that will disappear once the Plot is completed.
$Slide_T4_00	Let's not forget that a good book needs memorable places for the hero to visit !<br>So here is a third type of cards : The “Locations”!<br>They also have a specific effect, like the “Items”.<br><br>The difference consists in the effect range. A location will affect the entire Storyline (or a large part of it) and its effects are triggered once the Reading phase begins.
$Slide_T4_01	If you feel like you don’t have enough cards to complete your objective, then you can use the Inspire button.<br><br>You will draw 2 cards. But be careful, if you use this button more than 2 times, then you will also get Dark Thoughts in your Deck.
$Slide_T4_02	The Dark Toughts are specific cards. You can easily recognize them thanks to their black background.<br><br>They represent a real threat for you, so try to avoid amassing them.<br><br>You can play them or discard them (if you are allowed to) to get rid of them.
$Slide_T5_00	Well done ! You finally passed your writing test ! Now that you are ready , you need to understand how a book is structured.<br><br>As you can see, a it is composed of 3 Acts. Those Acts are defined by the Storyline you will select.<br><br>Each very Act is divided into 4 to 5 Chapters. You reach a new Chapter once you complete the objective of a Plot.<br><br>But be careful ! If the timer drops to 0, or if your Hero dies, then you will have to write your book again from the beginning.
$Dialogue_T0_00	Greetings Writer. I’m the protagonist of your future stories. You and I are now linked. That’s why I’ll help you during this lesson.
$Dialogue_T0_01	The Deck contains all your cards. If it’s empty, no worries, it will refill on its own using your Discard pile.
$Dialogue_T0_02	Speaking of which, here is your Discard pile. All the cards you play will finish here.
$Dialogue_T0_03	In this area of the board, you can store your cards. <br>If you draw a card while your Hand is full, you will have to discard one of them to get the new one.<br>You can play your card in your Hand on the different slots of the Storyline.
$Dialogue_T0_04	This is the Storyline. As you can see, each step is linked to a slot where you can place a card. <br>During the Reading phase, I will trigger the effect by walking on each of those steps.
$Dialogue_T0_05	The 'Go Button' allows you to start the Reading phase. Once you've clicked it, I will take the lead and live the story you prepared.
$Dialogue_T0_06	If you don’t understand something on the board, just keep the cursor over it. It will gives you advice.
$Dialogue_T0_07	Oh ! I forgot to mention something. Here are my statistics -yes, like in one of your favorite RPG-.
$Dialogue_T0_08	Enough small talk, let the game begins !
$Dialogue_T1_00	At the beginning of each turn you will draw cards. <br>Those cards represent your ideas.<br> We’ll call them 'Idea Cards'.
$Dialogue_T1_01	The cards you have just drawn are Items.
$Dialogue_T1_02	Now I will learn you how to use them. As you can see, there is an Ink Pot just under me.
$Dialogue_T1_03	This Ink Pot can be considered as the fuel of your writing. <br>To place a card, you need to spend some of it.<br> If you don’t have enough Ink, you cannot place it.
$Dialogue_T1_04	Place these two cards on the slots of the Storyline so iI can trigger them during the Reading phase.
$Dialogue_T1_05	Make sure that you've placed the two cards on the Storyline before using this button.
$Dialogue_T1_06	This Item's effect has a range. In that case, it affects myself by giving me HP.
$Dialogue_T1_07	Some cards might have effects which impact different targets on the board, <br>like the Deck for instance.
$Dialogue_T1_08	Now that the turn is over, the cards you used on the Storyline go to the discard pile.
$Dialogue_T1_09	I have to go back to the beginning of the Storyline. Don't worry, the Ink Pot will refill automatically !
$Dialogue_T2_00	It looks like you just found a Character !
$Dialogue_T2_01	I would like to show you something. Can you place your two Characters on adjacents slots ?
$Dialogue_T2_02	The Number of Use decreases by one at the end of the turn ! Once it is equal to 0, the card goes to the discard pile!
$Dialogue_T3_00	To complete a Plot, you need to fill the right conditions and place it on the Storyline. Once I reach it's location, the Plot is completed.
$Dialogue_T3_01	You can also place an Ally on the two sides of an Enemy. If it can take a hit, it will hit back the Enemy once I reach its position.
$Dialogue_T3_02	Normally it's not an obligation but for the example place the Plot card on the storyline.
$Dialogue_T3_03	Now that I reached the end of the Storyline, the turn is ended. The plot's timer drops by one and the card goes back to your Hand.
$Dialogue_T4_00	Oh, you’ve drawn a new type of card !
$Dialogue_T4_01	I think you’ve seen enough information to be autonomous ! Let this Plot ends !<br>...and try not to kill me !
